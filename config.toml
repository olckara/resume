                     Then I decided to take it to the next level and applied to Bilkent University Computer Technology \
                     and Information Systems department so I could become an IT professional. \
                     I don't see coding, building software solutions, dealing with infrastructure et cetera as a job or \
                     assignment. I have fun while doing it. I like being challenged and I feel joy in learning. I'm a \
                     quick learner and curious. I've tried out Linux in early ages, just out of curiosity. Today, \
                     I know about UNIX based systems beyond fundamentals and I continue learning and wondering. \
                     I love to create and I love to learn. My main purpose in life is to create solutions that can reach \
                     out to millions, solve their problems. I've been working as a Software Engineer for two years now. \
                     I've developed solutions in many programming languages including NodeJS/JavaScript, Scala, Java and Python. \
                     I've involved in CI/CD pipelines and worked with Scrum/Kanban teams."""
